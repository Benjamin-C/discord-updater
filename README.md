### Ben's Discord Update Script

Doesn't it seem like Discord wants to update *every single time* you use it? Then this is the script for you! It automatically checks for updates every time you start Discord, and only requires your minimal interaction when updates are required.

This was built on Gnome. You may have to modify it to fit your environment. Using Mac or Windows? This is probably not the script for you.

To install, put `run.sh` and `install-update.sh` in a folder somewhere where your user can run them, and make sure they are executable. Modify the `.desktop` file with the path of the script, then copy it to `~/.local/share/applications/`. It should replace your standard Discord launcher.
